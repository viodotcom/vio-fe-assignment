# HotelsSearchWidget

This directory is where you should implement your HotelsSearchWidget component.

## Requirements

Your HotelsSearchWidget should include:

1. **Place/Hotel Search**: An input field with autocomplete suggestions using the `/v1/suggest` endpoint
2. **Date Selection**: Two date pickers for check-in and check-out dates
3. **Guest Selection**: A numeric input for the number of guests
4. **Search Action**: A search button that calls the `/v1/search` endpoint
5. **Hotel List**: A list of hotels that match the search criteria and displays the hotel details received from the search request

### The Expected Outcome

1. Implement your solution in this directory
2. Add a new `widgets` page for this widget
3. Include the widget as an iframe on the homepage
4. Document your approach and any improvements made in the `NOTES.md` file

*Good luck, and have fun!*
