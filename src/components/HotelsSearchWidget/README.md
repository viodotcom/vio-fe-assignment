# HotelsSearchWidget

This directory is where you should implement your HotelsSearchWidget component.

## Requirements

Your HotelsSearchWidget should include:

1. **Place/Hotel Search**: An input field with autocomplete suggestions using the `/v1/suggest` endpoint
2. **Date Selection**: Two date pickers for check-in and check-out dates
3. **Guest Selection**: A numeric input for the number of guests
4. **Auto Search**: A search should be performed to the `/v1/search` endpoint automatically when the user changes any of the input fields.
5. **Hotel List**: A list of hotels that match the search criteria and displays the hotel details received from the search request

### The Expected Outcome

1. Implement your solution in this directory
2. Include the widget on the homepage in the provided section
3. Document your approach and any improvements made in the `NOTES.md` file
